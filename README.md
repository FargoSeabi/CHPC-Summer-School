# CHPC Summer School Project

Welcome to the **CHPC-Summer-School** repository! 🎓

This project contains the code, notebooks, and resources created as part of the *Centre for High Performance Computing (CHPC) Coding Summer School* coursework — where participants learn data analysis, Python programming, and data pipelines through real exercises and projects. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 📚 About

The **CHPC Coding Summer School** is a training initiative organized by the **Centre for High Performance Computing (CHPC)** and the **National Institute for Theoretical and Computational Science (NITheCS)** to equip students and researchers with foundational skills in programming, data science, and computational thinking. Lectures and hands-on tutorials typically cover:

- Python programming and data analysis  
- Data cleaning, processing, and automation  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data pipelines and analytics workflows  

The materials here were developed to support both learning and application of these core concepts. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 🗂 Repository Structure

| Folder / File | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `CoffeeData.py` | Python script for coffee dataset examples |
| `Data_Handling.py` | Data cleaning and preprocessing functions |
| `Data_Pipelines.py` | Data pipeline logic and automation |
| `Exploratory-Data-Analysis.py` | EDA examples and visualizations |
| `apps_data.csv`, `review_data.csv` | Example datasets used in scripts |
| `data_pipeline_streamlit.zip` | A zipped Streamlit app for data pipeline showcasing |
| `README.md` | This file |

> Note: There are also folders like `Scratch`/`Scratch2` that contain experimental code and exploratory work — good for learning but not core functions.
